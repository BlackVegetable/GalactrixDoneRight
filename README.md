This is a revision of the old BlackVegetable Comprehensive Balance Mod (CBM) for Galactrix.

This will include bug fixes, additional balance changes, typo fixes, and additional content.

I hope you enjoy,

Below is the game manual in a web-viewable format:

# Attribute (Levelup skills) Changes

## Shields

Shields now grant much more benefit per point of pilot skill. The AI is now much more resilient as it has been changed to prefer blue gems more than before. More importantly, shielding prevents nearly all status ailments from targeting your ship! Keeping your shields intact at even 1 point will prevent many nasty effects. Once a status ailment is on your ship, however, it will remain there even if you later restore shields. 

## Gunnery

Gunnery was easily the most powerful statistic in vanilla Galactrix. Now, gunnery grants up to +5 bonus damage when matching mines, with one point granted per 49 points of the skill. Note that the damage of mines bonus from your level has been reduced from 1 per 5 levels to 1 per 10 levels, effectively splitting the bonus evenly between the gunnery skill and your level (as the maximum player level is still 50.)

## Science

Science skill now grants an in-combat bonus and a non-combat bonus. First, when your skill reaches 75 points of science, you will have your first level of *cooldown reduction* which will lower the turns you must wait for an item to be usable again by one turn, down to a minimum of a 1 turn wait.

The non-combat bonus givven is *hacking key reduction* through which the number of matches required for any hcking mini-game is reduced. You will begin to benefit from this with 25 points in the science skill.

## Engineer

The engineering skill also grants both an in-combat bonus and a non-combat bonus. For every 25 points in this skill, you will be able to repair your hull (automatically) by 1 point each turn. At 245 points of engineer you will have 10 points each turn (not at the expected 250 -- the last level requires fewer points to reach) This hull repair effect is limited by *battle fatigue* which is explained later.

This skill also makes you better at the mining mini-game, giving you bonuses to resource collection per match. This bonus becomes available when you have 40 engineering points. Each additional 50 points from there grants the next level of bonus.
