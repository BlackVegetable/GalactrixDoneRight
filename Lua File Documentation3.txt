Note that some files existing only in the Balance Mod are listed.  They are marked as such and shouldn't be easily
confused with the Vanilla files.  Besides, there aren't THAT many of them. -- BlackVegetable

-- Beams Folder --

Each file in the Beams folder seems to contain the code for creating the "laser" effects in the battleground.

BM01.lua Laser(Damage) Beam
BM02.lua New Blue wave (shield) Beam
BM03.lua Small Blue Lightning Beam
BM04.lua Green Lightning (CPU Beam)
BM05.lua Yellow wave (engine) Beam
BM06.lua Small Blue Lightning Beam
BM07.lua Small Green Lightning (CPU Beam)
BM08.lua Weapon Lightning (Red Beam)
BM09.lua Small Red Lightning (Weapon Beam)
BM10.lua Small Purple Lightning (CPU Beam)
BM11.lua Purple Lightning (CPU Beam)
BM12.lua White Lightning (Intel Beam)
BM13.lua Small White Lightning (Intel Beam)

-- Crew Folder --

Each file in the Crew folder contains the mapping for the information on each crew member (their descriptions.)
The actual text is contained in the XML files it is pointing to.

C000.lua Kirine Thwaites
C001.lua Beta Prime
C002.lua ED24
C003.lua Guildmaster Lydia
C004.lua Pezt
C005.lua Sable
C006.lua Elgara

-- Data Folder --

Each of these files contains information on a specific topic.  In other words, they are data tables read by other
.lua files in various processes.

Cargo.lua  Contains informationon each mining inventory item.  The average cost of each is listed here as well as
Information on "amount" which I assume has something to do with either the freqency an item will appear in an asteroid
or how much of it will appear when it does, or both.  A few items also contain a "tech" value which I'd wager
affects the freqeuncy of it appearing based on the "tech" level of a system.

EnemyList.lua  This contains which NPC "Hero" belongs to which faction.  Also, it has a section labeled _G.INDUSTRY_MINING
but I don't really have any idea what that does.  It mostly doubles up with data higher up in the table anyway.

Factions.lua  contains information on each faction.  It sets up which icons belong to which faction, a color for each faction? (Red white or blue)
and the background for each factions area.  It also lists a home location coordinate pair, but I don't know what that is used for.
Most interestingly it contains the "opposing" faction for each, which will give you reputation changes with when you kill one or the other.

Governments.lua has the "law" level for each type of government.  The higher the law level, the greater the chance of getting caught
with contraband.  Amusingly enough, Corperations have a higher law level than dictatorships OR Democracies.  ;)

Industries.lua contains very little information.  It merely sets a Global function to map to a name.  Specifically, 
the various "Types" of systems are listed here.  I don't yet know what impact they have.

JumpGatesTable.lua is an auto-generated list of jumpgates.  It links a gate with the two systems it connects.
Since this is auto-generated, it would be wise to avoid modding this file.

MP_Enemies.lua is a list of all of the "Heores" available for multiplayer selection.  If you add a hero to the game
and would like it to be selectable in Multiplayer matches, you'll need to include it here.

QuestStart.lua has the starting locations for the various quests in the game?  It is auto-generated, and again,
seems to be unwise to alter.

Standings.lua contains some data on how a faction behaves toward the player based upon their reputation.  It has a value
for the cost of purchasing things from them, (the lower value seems to be an increase in cost) the color of the systems,
the sprite type shown for a ship of that faction standing, and the "safe distance."  I think this last value must control
the minimum distance you must maintain to not be followed and hunted down by another ship.  I don't know what the values
mean when the ships are friendly though.  Perhaps it is related to contraband.

StarLinks.lua Don't touch this file.  It is autogenerated and will give you the proper path to move from one system
to another in the map.  This way you can click on a system not immediately next to you and it will know which 
path to take to reach the destination.

StarTable.lua This is another auto-generated file.  I don't actaully know what it is listing.  If anyone has an idea, let me know.
  

-- Item Folder --

This folder contains a file for every item in the game, and a few that aren't in the game.  Each item file is denoted by
starting with the character "I" and then listed with a three digit code starting at 000 and presumably continuing until
999.  An item will contain a function with specified input parameters, effects when the item is "called," a function
telling the AI how often/when it should use an item (sometimes left blank which leaves it to be determined
elsewhere) and a return block containing important information such as the icon to use, energy requirements,
turns for recharge, "rarity", cost at a shop, whether it ends the turn when used, what sounds it makes,
and a couple lines of code that alter the capitalization of some other code and probably shouldn't be tinkered
with.  However, most of the data with items should be easy to change.  Just remember to change the
descriptions in the XML files when make a significant change that would merit a new description.  If you
make a new item, be sure to follow a similar format to the other existing items and also start
the filename with a capitol "I".

Item.lua contains the variables used by items as well as (all?) the functions called by items.

ItemLoadout.lua is a short file that defines a ship code and associated items.

ShipConfigFunctions.lua contains a couple functions pertaining to equipping ships.

-- BattleGrounds Folder --

This is a very valuable folder as it contains coding pertaining to each "BattleGround," that is, every
time you see a screen filled with some manner of gems, it is using one or more of these files to
determine behavior.

B000.lua Seems to be a blank, or very basic Battleground.  I'm not sure when it is used.
B001.lua Also contains very little but has some limited behavior regarding the end of "battles."
B002.lua Hacking
B003.lua Psi-Minigame (not in game)
B004.lua Seems to include a battlegound for "the first battle?"
B005.lua CPU Mini-Game (not in game)
B006.lua Mining
B007.lua [[[DOESN'T EXIST]]]
B008.lua Haggling
B009.lua "Old" Hacking (not in game)
B010.lua Crafting
B011.lua Rumor
B101.lua Multiplayer??
B102.lua Contains a small number of functions.  Not sure when it is used.

BattleGroundPlatform.lua Deals mostly with the graphics of moving gems.  Don't touch it.

FFXG.lua A small graphics-related file, don't touch it.
FFXS.lua Another small graphics-related file, don't touch it. (deals with sprites?)
FFXT.lua Another small graphics-related file, don't touch it. (deals with text?)
GMSG.lua Seems to deal mostly with graphics, but it's hard to tell.

HexBattleGround.lua The main file to change combat related details.  Using this and Hero.lua in
conjunction will give you a good deal of editing power.

HexBattleGroundEndStat.lua Deals with the end of combat.  Includes removing gems as well as 
awarding plans and modifying faction standings among other things.

InitBattleground.lua Sets up the battleground(s) and prepares starting values for variables. 
You can change how much energy you start a battle with here, for example.

InitBattlegroundPlatform.lua Seems to also set up the battleground for you but doesn't 
contain nearly as many functions and very few of them will be of interest to an editor. 
It does contain a funny comment at the beginning though.  (Well, I laughed anyway.)

InitGridPlatform.lua  Probably deals with setting up the randomness of gems?  Your guess
is as good as mine really.  But seriously, you shouldn't mess with files like this one.

MessageManager.lua A short file that handles the displaying of messages.  


-- Effects Folder --

This folder contains the status effects some items bring into play as well as the files used to govern them.

[FSxx is for Stats Effects]
FS01.lua Confusion 
FS02.lua Nova (Why it is called FS02 is a mystery to me.) 

[FTxx is for Time-Based Effects]
FT01.lua Chronotron Droid 
FT02.lua CPU Drain 
FT03.lua Shield Drain 
FT04.lua Shield Droid 
FT05.lua Time Loop 
FT06.lua Time Warp

FC16.lua Havoc Drone

EffectManager.lua contains the basic framework and attributes for effects.

EFCT.lua is a much more in-depth file on how effects work and contains the rest of the variables.



-- Satellites Folder --

This folder contains information on the planets, shops, stations etc. found througout the star systems.

ASTD.lua Asteroid Generic Data
MOON.lua Moon Generic Data
PLNT.lua Planet Generic Data
SHYD.lua "Shipyard" Generic Data
SPST.lua Space Station Generic Data

Satellite.lua Contains data concerning the movement and basic interaction of the player with the objects in space.
	I can't see a good reason to edit this file at the moment.

SatelliteManager.lua Sets up the attributes for each satellite.  Again, this is one that you're better off not editing.

SatellitePlatform.lua Sets up basic graphical behavior for satellites.  Don't wanna mess with it.
 
	Among the following, the garbled up name files are the names of asteroids.  If you know what you're doing, you could set
the types, amounts and required amounts of materials in an individual asteroids by editing those files.
	Secondly, note that to edit shops, you will not edit, say T005, but rather T005_shop as that file contains the items
sold at that particular store.
	Finally, if you select a planet that has a rumor board attached (I'm not listing it!) you can adjust the number of 
moves, the particular rumor it reveals and the intel reward from a particular discovery.

-- Psi Folder --

Psi powers are stored in this folder.  However, you may recognize that they aren't Psi powers that are in the game.
They were abandoned for the current, less ambitious system.  These may be good stepping stones to use if you are
interested in creating your own Psi powers. . .

P001.lua Psi Power 1 was supposed to Speed up your ship while in systems for "3 Days."
P002.lua Psi Power 2 was supposed to increase the cargo you gained from your next mining attempt.
P003.lua Psi Power 3 was supposed to help you in your next crafting attempt.
P004.lua Psi Power 4 wasn't defined, but was supposed to help you hacking somehow.
P005.lua Psi Power 5 was supposed to allow you to teleport to any previously visited system.
P006.lua Psi Power 6 was supposed to give you better prices on your next purchase or sale.
P007.lua Psi Power 7 was supposed to drain your enemy's shields by half at the start of your next battle.

Psi.lua Is the base class for all Psi powers.  The words, "time crease" show up here. . . (?)
